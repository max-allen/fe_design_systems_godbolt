## The Pillars of Frontend Architecture

> Every building needs a solid foundation, four walls, and a roof. Successful architects must provide these As FE architects, we are under a similar obligation any time we create a new web property.

Foundation of a scalable and sustainable design system. Our inch-deep, mile-wide understanding of the entire FE development space is what allows us to be champions for new technologies and methodologies. None of us are masters of all of them.

#### The Pillars

* Code
  
  How to approach the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a design system. Setting expectations for code written and assets created.
* Process

  Tools and processes that'll create an efficient and error-proof workflow. Gains  in productivity, efficiency, consistency v. over-engineering and unnecessary abstraction.

* Testing

  We need to ensure that any code we wrote yesterday isn't devalued by the code we write today. Creating a plan for sufficient test coverage. Different methods of testing

* Documentation

  > It seems that few see the value of spending time on documentation until a key member of the team is leaving, then it's "stop everything and document all the things."

  Documentation should be written at the same time as the process or artifact being developed. Various types of documentation, tools used for publication, types of end users for ingesting content.

### Code

> Good code never happens by accident. Left to our own devices, we are capable of producing a wide variety of solutions to the same problem. There's rarely a single best solution to any problem. We tackle problems differently because we have different experiences, opinions, and tendencies. There's nothing wrong with inconsistencies between devs. It's often our ability to look at problems differently that makes our teams stronger. But when it comes to writing solutions and committing, there's no desire or need for our code to reflect those differences.

The code pillar is here for conversations about code quality of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It defines how classes are written, functions are built, and how interfaces are marked up. As an architect, it's your job to continually explore and evaluate new techniques, platforms, methodologies, frameworks. No one size fits all solution. Discovering project needs and matching them up with current FE dev landscape is your responsibility.
